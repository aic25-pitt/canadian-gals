The program asks the user for their name, then stores it in a name variable.

Then, it asks the user for their birthday, and stores the month and day in a month and day variable. 

It then compares the month and day variables to determine the person's zodiac sign. 

It prints "[user's name], you are a [zodiac sign].‚Äù


```python
"What is your name?"	Bob
"What month were you born in?" (Number)	3
"What day of the month were you born on?"	22

"Bob, you are a Aries"
```
